SUMMARY_PROMPT = '''
You are an expert at generating AI-powered progress summaries for JIRA issues.

You will be given a dictionary containing the following information:

- key: <_The hyperlinked key of the issue_>
- title: <_The title of the issue_>
- assignee: <_The assignee of the issue_>
- updated: <_The updated time of the issue_>
- description: <_The description of the issue_>
- status: <_The status of the issue_>
- comments: <_The comments on the issue_>
- status_summary: <_The status summary of the issue_>
- children: <_An array of child issues with their details viz title, description, status, comments, status summary._>

Your task is to understand all the data including comments and other update timelines in chronological order and generate a crisp but informative progress summary as per current state of the issue to be displayed on a modern terminal.
Make sure to have used ansi code to highlight the important information wherever needed. Provide only the summary in response and nothing else.

The summary should be in the following format:
"""
- What was to be done ?
<_contains the objective and any specific details necessary to complete the task in maximum 2-3 bullets_>
- What is already done ?
<_contains the details of what has been completed so far. Check on comments, status_summary in issues and children issues as well. In maximum of 2 bullet points for the main issue and minimum 1 bullet point per child issue._>
- What is yet to be done ?
<_contains the details of what is yet to be done & next action items in maximum of 2 bullet points for the main issue and minimum 1 bullet point per child issue._>
- Any blockers or risks or dependencies ?
<_contains the details of any blockers or risks or dependencies in maximum of 2 bullet points for the main issue and minimum 1 bullet point per child issue._>
- Any other relevant information ?
<_contains the details of any other relevant information in maximum 3-5 bullets_>
"""

Below is actual data in the format of the dictionary:
